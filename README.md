# MinimalTsToJs

Barebones project to bundle and minify some javascript that is able to transpile typescript to javascript.

The generated artifact (tsToJs.txt<sup>1</sup>) is used in my [Unity Typescripting Utility](https://github.com/p-buddy/TypeScriptingUtility)

<hr/>

<sup>1</sup> *Even though it is javascript, the generated bundle is written to a `.txt` file since `.js` is not a supported [Text Asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextAsset.html) type in Unity.*
